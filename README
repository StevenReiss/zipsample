This directory contains a very simple web server you should bring up on
your virtual machine.

This directory is the main diredtory and contains the node.js source
files, a html subdirectory with static pages, and a views subdiretory
with mustache template pages.

The db directory contains everything needed for the database.

You should first use npm to update/install all the various packages
needed by ndoe (the package.json file should be correct).

	PROPMT$ npm install
	PROMPT$ npm update

Then you should set up the database:

a) First determine the options needed to run mysql (will have host, user options)
	Let the command be #MYSQL#

b)  Run this command with zipdump.sql as input:

	PROMPT$ #MYSQL# < zipdump.sql

You should edit the constants in config.js as appropriate.

You might have to open a port (the one listed in  config.js) to make the server
accessible externally

Finally, you should add a default web page (using the normal server) that
redirects to this server.
